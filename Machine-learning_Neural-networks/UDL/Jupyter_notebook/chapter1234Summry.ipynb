    "  <h3 style=\"color: #eee; font-size: 22px; margin-top: 20px;\">1. Basic Concept of Regression and Neural Networks</h3>\n",
    "  <p><strong>Your question:</strong> You said that in regression, you want to fit a line minimizing distance from data points, and predict new inputs with a function.</p>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My answer:</strong> Exactly! In regression, we fit a function to minimize error. In neural networks, nonlinear activations like ReLU allow complex function modeling. Prediction for new inputs is possible because the model learns the function by adjusting weights and biases.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <h3 style=\"color: #eee; font-size: 16px; margin-top: 24px;\">2. Layers in a Neural Network</h3>\n",
    "  <p><strong>Your question:</strong> Neural networks have input, hidden, and output layers.</p>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My answer:</strong> Correct! Layers are:</p>\n",
    "  <ul style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\n",
    "    <li><strong>Input:</strong> Just passes the data.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Hidden:</strong> Processes data with weights, biases, and activations.</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Produces the final result.</li>\n",
    "  </ul>\n",
    "  <h3 style=\"color: #34495e;\">3. Role of Activation Functions (ReLU)</h3>\n",
    "  <p><strong>Your question:</strong> ReLU breaks curves into line segments, making them easier to model. Related to the universal approximation theorem.</p>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My answer:</strong> Exactly! ReLU (\\(\\max(0, x)\\)) approximates curves with piecewise linear segments. Combining multiple neurons leads to complex curve approximation. Correction: full curve shaping comes from the network structure (weights + biases), not ReLU alone.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <h3 style=\"color: #34495e;\">4. Why ReLU is Popular</h3>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My question:</strong> Why is ReLU popular?</p>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My answer:</strong> Because of its simplicity and piecewise linearity. Main reasons:</p>\n",
    "  <ul>\n",
    "    <li>Fast computation</li>\n",
    "    <li>Solves vanishing gradients</li>\n",
    "    <li>Neurons are either active or not (interpretability)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Creates sparsity (some outputs are zero)</li>\n",
    "  </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <h3 style=\"color: #34495e;\">5. Adding Neurons or Layers for Better Approximation</h3>\n",
    "  <p><strong>Your question:</strong> Should we add neurons or layers to better fit curves?</p>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My answer:</strong> Adding <strong>neurons</strong> increases segments and improves curve fitting. Adding <strong>layers</strong> helps with hierarchical features, but for simple curves, more neurons are enough.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <h3 style=\"color: #34495e;\">6. Approximating a Complex Function</h3>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My question:</strong> For oscillating curves, what should we do?</p>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My answer:</strong> Increase the number of neurons! More neurons = more segments = better fit. Universal Approximation Theorem guarantees that a single hidden layer with enough neurons can approximate any continuous function.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <h3 style=\"color: #34495e;\">7. Weights and Biases</h3>\n",
    "  <p><strong>Your question:</strong> What are weights and biases?</p>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My answer:</strong></p>\n",
    "  <ul>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Weights:</strong> Control the influence of inputs on outputs (slope of line).</li>\n",
    "    <li><strong>Biases:</strong> Shift the function (like intercept).</li>\n",
    "  </ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <h3 style=\"color: #34495e;\">8. Bias and Intercept</h3>\n",
    "  <p><strong>Your question:</strong> Is bias the same as intercept?</p>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My answer:</strong> Yes, in a linear equation \\(z = wx + b\\), bias \\(b\\) acts exactly like an intercept. It also influences activation points in networks with ReLU.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <h3 style=\"color: #34495e;\">9. Weights and Biases in the Input Layer</h3>\n",
    "  <p><strong>Your question:</strong> Are weights and biases applied to input neurons?</p>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My answer:</strong> No. Input layer neurons just hold the input data without applying weights or biases. Computations start from the first hidden layer.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <h3 style=\"color: #34495e;\">10. Graphical Representation of Neural Networks</h3>\n",
    "  <p><strong>Your question:</strong> In diagrams, are nodes neurons and edges weighted paths?</p>\n",
    "  <p><strong>My answer:</strong> Exactly! Nodes represent neurons, edges represent weighted connections. Biases are not on edges, they are added inside neurons.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "  <h3 style=\"color: #2c3e50;\">Key Takeaways</h3>\n",
    "  <ul>\n",
    "    <li>Shallow neural networks (1 hidden layer) + ReLU can approximate any continuous function.</li>\n",
    "    <li>More neurons = better function approximation (more line segments).</li>\n",
    "    <li>Weights = control input effect; Biases = shift outputs.</li>\n",
    "    <li>ReLU = fast, interpretable, piecewise linear function.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Network graphs: nodes = neurons, edges = weighted connections.</li>\n",
    "  </ul>\n",
