## Chapter 1: Introduction to Interviewing
Interviews are crucial for identifying top candidates. Interviewers must assess a candidate’s skills and potential while ensuring a positive experience. Key points:
- A bad hire is costly due to lost productivity and morale impact.
- Dismissing employees is difficult, so careful hiring is essential.
- Good candidates should be evaluated based on intelligence, dedication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills.
- An interview should have a clear decision, avoiding indecisiveness.
- Even rejected candidates should leave with a positive impression of the company.
- There are dozens of
  such texts and our preference is to master one or two good books rather than superficially sample
  many. __Algorithms by Dasgupta__, et al. is succinct and beautifully written; __lntroduction to Algorithms
  by Cormen__, et al. is an amazing reference.

## Chapter 2: Structuring an Interview
Interviewers should tailor questions to their organization’s needs:
- Startups need immediate productivity, so specific technical skills are crucial.
- Large organizations prioritize problem-solving, algorithms, and system design over domain knowledge.
- Successful companies often hire based on ability and potential rather than prior experience.
- Companies use structured interviews, with different interviewers evaluating different skills (coding, algorithms, system design, etc.).
- When selecting questions:
  - Avoid single-point failure questions.
  - Prefer problems with multiple solutions.
  - Choose questions that test multiple skill areas.
  - Ensure problems are calibrated with colleagues.
  - Avoid unnecessary domain knowledge unless relevant.

|Greedy algorithms  |Compute a solution in stages, making choices that are locally optimum at each step; these choices are never undone.            |
|Invariants         |Identify an invariant and use it to rule out potential solutions that are suboptimafdominated by other solutions.              |
|Graph modeling     |Describe the problem using a $aph and solve it using an existing graph algorithm.                                              |

 - Letting your interviewers know that you have researched them helps break the ice and forms
    the impression that you are enthusiastic and will go the extra mile.<br>
  - More generally, if you do not believe in yourself, you cannot expect others to believe in you<br>
  - An offer is not an offer till it is on paper, with all the details filled in.<br>
  - The ideal candidate is smart, dedicated, articulate, collegial, and gets things done quickly, both as an individual and in a team<br>
  
  
## Chapter 3: Conducting the Interview
Interviewers must balance evaluating responses, keeping the conversation flowing, and taking notes. Common challenges:
- **Silent Candidates:** Some get intimidated and shut down. Encourage them with hints and reassurance.
- **Verbose Candidates:** Some talk too much without progressing. Guide them back on track.
- **Overconfident Candidates:** Some defend wrong answers. Help them see their mistake with test cases.

### Scoring and Decision-Making
- Keep detailed notes, including whiteboard snapshots and code samples.
- Standardize scoring based on hints given and questions answered.
- Minor mistakes can be overlooked, but repeated errors signal weakness.
- If unsure, wait for the next candidate rather than making a risky hire.
- The final test: Would you be happy if the candidate replaced a valuable team member?
