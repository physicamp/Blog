# 🔍 ReLU vs. Taylor Series vs. Fourier Series: A Functional Approximation Perspective

Neural networks with ReLU activation functions can be understood as a powerful method for **approximating complex functions** using simpler building blocks — just like **Taylor series** and **Fourier series** do in classical mathematics.

This note explores how ReLU functions relate to those classical methods of approximation.

## 📌 The Core Idea of All Three

> **Build complex functions by combining simple ones.**

---

## 📘 1. Taylor Series

Taylor expansion approximates a complex, smooth function using **polynomial functions** around a given point:

\[
f(x) \approx a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3 x^3 + \cdots
\]

✅ **Basis functions**: Polynomials  
✅ **Used for**: Local approximation around a point

---

## 📗 2. Fourier Series

Fourier series approximates periodic functions by summing **sine and cosine** terms:

\[
f(x) \approx a_0 + a_1 \cos(x) + b_1 \sin(x) + a_2 \cos(2x) + b_2 \sin(2x) + \cdots
\]

✅ **Basis functions**: Sine and cosine waves  
✅ **Used for**: Periodic signals and functions

## 📙 3. Neural Networks with ReLU

ReLU networks approximate arbitrary functions by combining **piecewise linear functions**. A simple ReLU network may look like:

\[
f(x) = w_0 + w_1 \text{ReLU}(a_1x + b_1) + w_2 \text{ReLU}(a_2x + b_2) + \cdots
\]

Where:

\[
\text{ReLU}(z) = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } z < 0 \\
z & \text{if } z \geq 0
\end{cases}
\]

✅ **Basis functions**: Piecewise linear (ReLU)  
✅ **Used for**: Universal function approximation

## 🧠 Summary Table

| Method              | Basis Functions         | Approximation Type               |
|---------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Taylor Series**   | Polynomials               | Local smooth functions           |
| **Fourier Series**  | Sine and cosine functions | Periodic functions               |
| **ReLU Networks**   | Piecewise linear functions | Arbitrary (possibly non-smooth) functions |

## ✅ Conclusion

> Just as Taylor series and Fourier series build complex functions using simple mathematical components (polynomials and trigonometric functions), **ReLU neural networks** build complex mappings by combining simple **linear pieces** using the ReLU activation.

This makes ReLU-based networks a modern, learnable version of classical function approximation techniques — but with **data-driven, adaptive flexibility**.
